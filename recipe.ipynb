        "# Safety Editing with Llama-3-8B and PKE 🚀\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is a demonstration of applying safety edits to the Meta-Llama-3-8B model using Precision Knowledge Editing (PKE). While the notebook provides a conceptual recipe, its focus is on the unique approach taken within the _locate_toxic_layer method, which is the core differentiator in this process. This method helps to pinpoint the model layers contributing most significantly to harmful outputs, guiding the application of targeted edits.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Highlights\n",
        "Locating the \"Toxic\" Layer:\n",
        "\n",
        "The _locate_toxic_layer method is the central innovation in this notebook. This approach identifies specific layers by examining weight changes and activation gradients for each layer, using them as indicators of layers that most influence the model’s undesirable behaviors. This targeted approach allows us to intervene precisely, rather than applying broad, potentially disruptive changes across the entire model.\n",
        "Key Points to Note: Users should focus on understanding this method, as it provides a flexible foundation for various editing techniques. The methodology here can be adapted to address different safety and specificity needs by altering which indicators (weight changes, gradient norms) are considered most relevant.\n",
        "Model Editing with apply_algo:\n",
        "\n",
        "The apply_algo function is referenced as a placeholder in this notebook. Users are encouraged to implement or customize this function according to their requirements. The editing algorithm can vary significantly depending on the type and extent of changes desired.\n",
        "Customization: apply_algo is left intentionally open-ended to allow users to adapt this framework to different editing needs. The function can be as simple or complex as required, allowing users to refine the PKE process to meet their model’s performance and safety goals.\n",
